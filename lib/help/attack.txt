=== Attacking ===

--- Melee attacks ---

If you walk into a monster, you can attack it with your weapon.
Your chance to hit is determined by your 'to hit' bonus from 
equipment etc. and the monster's AC. The higher the 'to-hit' bonus 
the easier it is to hit, the higher the monster's AC is the harder.

On hitting the damage is decided by the weapon's dice, 'to damage' 
bonus after adjustment for AC protection.  'Slay' effects and 
any elemental branding are included in the calculations.  'Slay'
and elemental effects only apply to the dice part.

Weapons that are heavy and have large dice is good for melee attacks.

There are also 'critical hits' that depend both on the 'to hit' 
bonus and on the weight of the weapon.  This also applies to the 
dice portion only.  The heavier the weapon the harder the critical
hits are.

Thus the heavier, and the larger the base dice, the stronger the 
weapon is (although you should also take into account how many blows
it can deal).


--- Shooting ---

If you fire an arrow or shot with sling, bow or crossbow equiped 
you carry out a ranged attack.  Note that this is NOT the same as 
the 'throw' command.

Whether you hit depends both on the missile weapon equiped and 
on the ammunition used, but damage is only dependent on the 
missile.  

By moving the target off-position it is possible to hit monsters
in the missile's path (even if they are out of sight, invisible, 
etc.)


--- Spell casting ---

If you cast attack spells, you can attack monsters by spells.
Well, obviously.  

Ball, beam and breath attacks pass over monsters but 
a bolt spell will stop as it hits the first monster in the way.

There are also some rods and wands that attack in the same way
as attack spells.
