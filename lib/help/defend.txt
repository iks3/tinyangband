=== Defence ===

--- AC ---

AC means both of avoidance and defence power.
When you depend on melee attacks, you should keep high AC.

AC(Armor Class) is a value determined both by dexterity and
equipment bonuses.  It indicates both ability to absorb damage
from hits and to avoid being hit.

If AC is high you don't just find it easy to avoid hits from
the enemy the 'un-branded' (non-elemental) damage from hits
is also reduced.

For melee classes like warriors its best to have high AC.


--- Resistance ---

Resistance applies not just to branded melee attacks, but also shows
protection from magic and breath attacks.  Damage from attack types
you have resistance to are reduced by on half to two thirds.

You can also prevent secondary effects from branded attacks.  
Avoiding confusion, making it less likely that items burn, etc.

Finally the five basic resistances Acid, Cold, Electricity, Flame and 
Poision can have double-resistances by using magic or potion effects
on top of those provided by equipment.  Very useful indeed.

--- Magic Defence ---

If your magic defence is high you will be able to better block 
effects like curses and 'hand of destruction'.
