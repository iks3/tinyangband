=== Rules of the Arena ===

The Arena is a contest pitting the best against each other.
To ensure a good contest, note the following:
  1) NO MAGIC - No potions, wands, staffs, etc.
  2) NO THROWS- This is head-to-head.
If fortunate, you will face the Minotaur, most feared of all
in the arena.  Defeat him and claim the prize of 10,000 gold pieces.
