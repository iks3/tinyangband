[1] Original keyset
[2] Roguelike keyset

--- Melee attack ---

Move into a monster and you will attack it.  The same applies even if it
is in a wall.

--- Running ---

Hold down a shift-key while moving.  You can't run directly next to a
monster.  You stop running when a monster in sight moves.

--- Attack without moving ---

Use movement key while holding down the control key.  This is useful to
avoid accidentally going around a corner or into a room.

--- Command counts ---

Press '0' and you can enter a number.  The following command key is 
carried out that number of times.
Ex. 099s -> Search 99 times

--- Macro ---

If you press the macro trigger key setup with '@' it exectutes the 
actions associated with it.
Ex. @ 4 tab \ef0*t\e -> Press tab and you will fire the ammo inscribed
with @f0 at the nearest enemy.

Note that some keys cannot be used, depending on your system.
