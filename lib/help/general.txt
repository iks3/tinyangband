--- An Overview ---

Angband variants is very fun, and they often steal our time very much.
We are often tired of adventures, especially search of excellent 
objects. If you play TinyAngband, you can win in a short time with 
enough adventures.

At first, you should make your charactor.
Select a race and a class. A magic realm is decided depend on your 
class.

Autoroller runs to decide stats of your charactor and decides your
valar patron. If you are displeased with him/her, push 'r' to reroll.

After you input a name and a personal history of your charctor,
the game will start.

In you first play, you should set options, especially auto destroy 
options and warning options.

Then, go to the general store ('1' on the screen).

After buying a lantern, go down the dungeon. Quest monsters are in 5th,
10th, 15th, 20th and 25th floor.

If you defeat Sauron at 26th floor, the stair to 27th floor will 
appear. Go down and kill morgoth at 27th floor.

When Current HP become under 0, your charactor die. Play next game.
