<div>Morgoth is supposed to return in the time of Dagor Dagorath, but I ignored that and had him recover early.  My appologies to people bothered by such things.  If you could pretend that it's an omen of Dagor Dagorath for me ...</div>
<div>TinyAngband is based on XAngband, but has been changed a lot (and will probably continue to change).</div>
